The issue lies in the useEffect dependency array including a function that is recreated on each render, causing an infinite loop. To fix this, we need to memoize the function using useCallback:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const myFunction = useCallback(() => {
    console.log('Function executed');
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('useEffect executed');
  }, [myFunction]);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

By using `useCallback`, the `myFunction` is only recreated when its dependencies (the empty array `[]`) change.  This prevents the infinite loop because the `useEffect` hook only runs when `myFunction` changes, which now only happens when the component initially mounts.
